# PythonWorks

This project will consist of python code I have written to solve smaller problems.

These can be from interview type questions or other interesting ways of solving problems.

The idea is to build a single project that I call pull ideas and knowledge from to help in larger projects.

Index:

1.FizzBuzz = Create a function that will print the numbers 1 to 100, however if the number is a multiple of 3 print fizz, if a multiple of 5 print buzz. If it is a multiple of 3 and 5 print FizzBuzz
